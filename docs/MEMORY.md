# Memory — project state

**Purpose:** the handoff file. A new Claude Code session, a different AI tool, or
future-you after three weeks away should be able to read this and know exactly
where things stand without re-reading the repo.

**Update it at the end of any session that changed project state.** Not every
session — a session that only answered questions changes nothing.

> **Note on the name.** Claude Code has its own automatic memory at
> `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/MEMORY.md`. That one is machine-local: it
> does not travel with the repo, across machines, or to another tool. This file is
> committed to the repo, which is what makes it portable. They coexist; keep this
> one authoritative for project state.

## Current state

**Phase:** 0 — Foundation, checklist complete and deployed. Moving to Phase 1.
**Last updated:** 2026-08-10

### Done

- Project scoped through five phases
- Phase 1 design settled: manual entry primary, email detection confirmatory,
  reconciliation between them
- Insurance re-quoting descoped with rationale recorded
- Documentation set written
- Stack chosen (see `TOOLS.md`)
- Repo initialised, pushed to `github.com/nobinDas/Shopping_buddy`
- TypeScript strict config, ESLint (flat config, boundary rules for
  `domain/` and `lib/`), Prettier — all wired and verified
- Next.js App Router skeleton, Tailwind v4 wired to the `DESIGN.md` tokens
- Real Supabase project (`shopping buddy`), Drizzle configured, one trivial
  migration applied and independently verified (see ADR-006)
- Single-user auth: Supabase magic-link sign-in, middleware-gated routes,
  sign-out — working end to end against real email delivery (Gmail SMTP)
- Vitest (real unit test: `addMoney`, enforces the no-cross-currency-arithmetic
  rule), Playwright (real E2E: auth redirect gate + login page render)
- `pnpm verify` wired (typecheck + lint + test + test:int) and genuinely green
  — the integration test writes/reads the real Supabase Postgres inside a
  transaction, rolled back and independently confirmed empty afterward
- CI (GitHub Actions): `verify` job on every push/PR, `e2e` job on PR only,
  watched to a real green run, not just configured
- `.env.example` verified complete against an actual grep of the codebase's
  `process.env` reads, not assumed
- Deployed to Vercel production: `https://shopping-buddy-beta.vercel.app`,
  auth gate verified live (unauthenticated `/` → 307 → `/login`, form renders)

### In progress

Nothing mid-task. All 9 Phase 0 checklist items and the exit criteria are done.

### Next

Phase 1a — subscriptions schema (money as integer minor units), create/edit/
archive, billing cycle handling, next-billing-date computation, list view.
See `PHASES.md`.

### Blocked

Nothing.

## Open questions

Things genuinely undecided. Resolving one means moving it to `DECISIONS.md` with
its rationale and deleting it here.

- Encryption key management for OAuth tokens: env var for now, but what is the
  rotation story?
- Supabase Auth's "Site URL" setting can only point at one place — currently
  `localhost:3000`, kept there deliberately so local magic-link testing keeps
  working. Production (`shopping-buddy-beta.vercel.app`) is deployed and its
  auth *gate* works, but a magic-link request made from production would
  currently email a localhost link. Revisit when the app moves from "being
  built" to "in real daily use" — likely needs separate dev/prod Supabase
  projects (a real cost: two schemas to keep in sync) rather than the single
  shared project from ADR-006, or accept manually flipping Site URL when
  testing production auth end to end.
- Timezone handling for billing dates — the user's zone, or the vendor's? They
  diverge for annual renewals near month boundaries.
- Sync frequency: daily is the assumption. Is it enough to catch a trial
  conversion before it bills?

## How to update this file

At the end of a working session, rewrite the sections above to reflect reality —
this is a snapshot, not a log. Then append a dated entry to the log below.

Keep the snapshot short. If it grows past a screen, detail has leaked in that
belongs in `PHASES.md` (progress), `DECISIONS.md` (choices), or `LEARNED.md`
(insight).

## Session log

Newest first. One entry per working session. Four lines each:

```
### YYYY-MM-DD — short title
**Did:** what changed
**Decided:** any choice made, with a link to the DECISIONS.md entry
**Next:** the immediate next action
```

Say what was *actually done*, not what was discussed. A session that explored
options and settled nothing should say so — that is useful information for the
next session, and pretending otherwise wastes its time.

### 2026-08-10 — Phase 0 complete: 0.5–0.9 plus a real Vercel deploy
**Did:** Vitest, Playwright, `pnpm verify`, CI, and `.env.example` finished —
all with real content, not placeholders (see each item's own commit message
for specifics; summarized in Current State above). Linked and deployed the
project to Vercel production (`nobindas-projects/shopping-buddy`), set the
three required env vars via `vercel env add` piped from `.env.local` (never
typed into chat), and verified the live deployment's auth gate with curl —
same checks used locally throughout Phase 0.4. GitHub's Vercel integration
failed to auto-connect (would need re-authorizing the Vercel GitHub App
separately); deploys are CLI-triggered for now, not automatic on push.
**Decided:** Leave Supabase Auth's Site URL on localhost rather than switching
to production — added as an open question above rather than silently
resolved either way.
**Next:** Phase 1a — subscriptions schema and manual entry, the first Phase 1
feature and the primary data source per `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`.

---

### 2026-08-10 — Phase 0.1–0.4 done: tooling, skeleton, Supabase, auth
**Did:** Repo/TS/ESLint/Prettier set up and verified. Next.js App Router
skeleton with Tailwind wired to `DESIGN.md` tokens. Real Supabase project
created, Drizzle configured, first migration applied and confirmed via
`list_tables`. Single-user magic-link auth built, debugged, and confirmed
working end to end (real email received, real click-through, real session).
Three real bugs found and fixed along the way, recorded in `LEARNED.md`:
Supabase's PostgREST exposes every table by default (RLS must be explicit
per table going forward — now a `SECURITY.md` checklist item), Gmail's
link-prefetching silently burns magic-link tokens before the user clicks
(fixed with a click-to-confirm page instead of verify-on-GET), and Gmail
SMTP requires an App Password, not the account password or any other
credential — this got confused with the database password mid-session and
cost real time.
**Decided:** Real Supabase project for local dev too, not Docker Postgres —
see ADR-006. Rationale: Phase 0.4 needed real Supabase Auth, which Docker
Postgres alone can't provide.
**Next:** Phase 0.5 — Vitest configured with one passing unit test.

---

### 2026-08-08 — Project scoped and documented
**Did:** Settled the project shape across five phases. Wrote the documentation set.
Chose the stack: self-built Next.js app with Claude API for classification, over
an enterprise agent platform or a local model.
**Decided:** Manual entry is the primary data source. Insurance re-quoting is out
of scope. Phase 0 added ahead of Phase 1 for foundation work. See `DECISIONS.md`.
**Next:** Phase 0 — repo initialisation and app skeleton.
